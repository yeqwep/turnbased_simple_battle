# 🎮 Defold Turn-Based Battle Sample

This is a **super simple sample project** showing how to make a **classic JRPG-style turn-based battle** in the Defold game engine.  
It’s not a full game — just the basics, easy to read, and perfect for learning or tinkering.

## What’s Inside?
- A **tiny turn-based battle system** (heroes vs enemies)  
- Just **two scripts do all the magic**:  
  1. **battle.script** → handles **state transitions** + **battle data**  
  2. **battle.gui_script** → handles **text display** + **player input**
